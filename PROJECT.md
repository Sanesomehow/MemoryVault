# MemoryVault - Decentralized Photo Sharing Platform

## 🚀 Project Overview

MemoryVault is a revolutionary photo sharing platform that transforms how we store, own, and share our digital memories. By combining blockchain technology with end-to-end encryption, we're creating a new paradigm for digital photo ownership and privacy.

## 🔒 The Problem: Centralized Photo Storage Privacy Crisis

Current photo storage solutions suffer from fundamental privacy and ownership issues:

- **Data Vulnerability**: Centralized servers are honeypots for hackers and data breaches
- **Privacy Erosion**: Tech giants scan, analyze, and monetize your personal photos
- **Lock-in Effect**: Your photos are trapped in proprietary ecosystems
- **Censorship Risk**: Platforms can arbitrarily remove or restrict access to your content
- **No True Ownership**: You don't actually own your digital memories - you're just renting storage space

### Real-World Impact
- Over 533 million Facebook users had their data exposed in 2021
- Cloud photo services regularly experience outages, making your memories temporarily inaccessible
- Algorithm changes can hide your photos from friends and family
- Platform closures or policy changes can result in permanent data loss

## 💡 Our Solution: End-to-End Encrypted Photos as NFTs

MemoryVault addresses these critical issues through innovative blockchain technology:

### Core Features
1. **True Digital Ownership**: Photos are minted as NFTs on the Solana blockchain, giving you verifiable ownership
2. **End-to-End Encryption**: Photos are encrypted before upload, ensuring only you and authorized viewers can access them
3. **Decentralized Storage**: Leverages IPFS for distributed, censorship-resistant storage
4. **Selective Sharing**: Grant granular access permissions to specific individuals or groups
5. **Social Integration**: Seamless sharing through Solana Blinks technology

### How It Works
```
User Upload → E2E Encryption → IPFS Storage → NFT Minting → Blockchain Record
     ↓
Selective Sharing → Access Control → Blinks Generation → Social Distribution
```
